# Getting Started with **Lens Loom**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the gallery in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The gallery page will automatically reload when you make edits.\
You may also see lint errors in the console, which can help identify any issues in your code.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [testing guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information on writing and running tests for the gallery.

### `npm run build`

Builds the gallery for production, optimizing it for performance.\
The output files will be in the `build` folder.

During the build process, React will optimize your code by minifying and including hashes in filenames.\
Your gallery will then be ready for deployment on various platforms.

Learn more in the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot undo this action!**

If you wish to customize the build configurations further, you can run `eject`. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies, giving you complete control over the setup.

This is an advanced option. Only use it if you are confident in customizing webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other dependencies.
